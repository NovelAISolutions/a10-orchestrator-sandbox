<title>Create a single-page, girly-themed Labubu showcase website with sections for About, Gallery, and Contact. Use pastel pink and lavender colors, cute rounded fonts, and soft button shadows. Include two placeholder images of Labubu toys (use random image URLs like https://placekitten.com/400/300). Add a short description paragraph about Labubu in the About section, a Gallery section with two images side-by-side, and a Contact section with sample details like Email and Instagram. Keep it simple and visually adorable with clean layout and smooth transitions.</title>
